# DSPy Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Narrative Deconstruction Toolkit from hardcoded prompt-based analysis to a modern DSPy framework implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- Added `dspy-ai==2.5.14` to requirements.txt
- Installed DSPy framework and dependencies

### 2. New DSPy Program (`core/dspy_program.py`)
- **FoundationalAssumptionsSignature**: Identifies unstated assumptions authors take for granted
- **SentenceAnalysisSignature**: Analyzes bias and rhetorical tactics in individual sentences  
- **OmissionsAnalysisSignature**: Identifies missing perspectives and evidence
- **DeconstructionPipeline**: Main orchestration module that runs all three analyses

### 3. Refactored Analysis Service (`services/analyzer.py`)
- Replaced manual OpenAI API calls with DSPy LM configuration
- Updated `run_synthesis_analysis()` to use the DSPy pipeline
- Removed deprecated helper functions:
  - `_get_foundational_assumptions()`
  - `_get_sentence_analysis()`
  - `_get_omissions_analysis()`
  - `_safe_json_parse()`
  - `_clean_sentence_analysis_data()`
  - `_clean_omissions_data()`

### 4. Legacy Prompts Deprecated (`core/prompts.py`)
- Added deprecation notice explaining DSPy migration
- Kept for reference but no longer used in the application

## Key Benefits

### Reliability
- Eliminates brittle JSON parsing and manual prompt engineering
- DSPy handles output formatting and type coercion automatically
- Better error handling through structured programming approach

### Maintainability  
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated signatures for each analysis type
- Programmatic approach vs. string-based prompt management
- Type-safe outputs using Pydantic models

### Optimization Ready
- Foundation laid for future DSPy teleprompter optimization
- Can systematically improve prompts through data-driven methods
- Ready for few-shot learning and prompt optimization

## Testing Results
✅ DSPy pipeline correctly processes text input
✅ Returns properly structured SynthesisResult objects
✅ FastAPI integration working seamlessly
✅ All three analysis components functioning:
- Foundational assumptions extraction
- Sentence-level bias analysis with rhetorical tactics
- Omissions identification

## API Compatibility
The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility with existing API endpoints:
- Same input format (`SynthesisRequest`)
- Same output format (`SynthesisResult`)
- No breaking changes to the REST API

## Future Enhancements
With DSPy in place, the application is now ready for:
- Systematic prompt optimization using DSPy teleprompters
- Few-shot learning examples to improve accuracy
- Advanced output adapters for better structure parsing
- Multi-model ensembles for improved reliability
